# grid-ai-sim
Demo project of a simple AI simulation on a grid.

## Build requirements
The project is configured for build with UE5.3.2

## Description
The idea of the project is to generate and manage the grid, to simulate AI behavior on a grid, and to learn and show some bits of AI algorithms. The main focus is on the algorithms, not the work with the framework, so sometimes the usage of UE framework files may look misleading, bear with me (the project with the Lyra-ish usage of UE classes and tools may join the portfolio soon as well).

### Features (so far)
A pre-set number of game actors gets spawned at the grid of given dimensions and start moving towards the closest opponent to attack them at the fixed time steps.

Main classes used in the simulation so far:
1. GameMode class
  * Has the majority of required properties for the simulation customization, like:
    - grid Dimensions (SizeX, SizeY);
    - grid cell size for translation grid to world coordinates;
    - number of actors per team;
    - a range for randomizing HP;
    - a range for randomizing Attack power;
    - simulation step duration (but rather just a step delay);
  * Is responsible for triggering the grid generation
  * Manages the simulation process (start, step, end)
  * Actors spawning
  
2. GameActor
  * Is mostly used for representing an actor of the grid and for holding information about the grid actor:
    - grid cell index;
    - grid cell coordinates;
    - team;
    - material instances for the team representation;
    - attack power value generated by GameMode;
    - health value generated and modified by GameMode

3. Pathfinder
  * Contains the implementation for the A* algorithm for GameMode to be used.
