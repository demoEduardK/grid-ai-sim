[Add game actors]
Add a couple of actors from City of Brass enemies pack.
Modify materials and add new material instances to represent teams.
Add actor states and corresponding animations (yup, no AnimInstances for now. I don't want whether I want them here or not, yet)
Rework a bit the attributes, so the big dudes got chonky, and the skellies got the damage.
Add base Health and Attack Power attributes to the game actors along with a max value for a random fracture of the attributes.
Make one of the enemies ranged, so they can attack one grid cell further and deliver more damage. Quickly adapt and check the existing functionality of target searching.



[Initial Merge]
Create a portfolio project based on the files of my recent learning project.

Add grid related functionality
Add A* implementation for finding the next suitable position on the grid, when the pass is blocked by ally actors.
Add a simple actor to represent changes on the grid.
Add a bit of debugging methods for logging and visualization.
Add a default GameMode that currently single handed controls the whole simulation process.
